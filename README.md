**Phase 1 Project**



**Overview**



This project explores over 90,000 aviation incidents to uncover hidden trends and high-risk patterns across flight operations,

aiming to identify the safest aircraft makes for business investment.

Using Python for data wrangling and Tableau for visual storytelling, we analyze key variables such as event dates, locations, aircraft makes, engine types.



**Business Understanding**



The company is expanding its investment portfolio by entering the aviation industry. 

As part of this strategic move, the company requires a data-driven assessment of historical aircraft incidents and accidents to evaluate operational risks.



This project leverages aviation data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to uncover trends in aircraft make, 

flight purpose, injury severity, and incident frequency. 

The objective is to identify lower-risk aircraft types and flight operations to support safer and more informed business decisions.


**Stakeholders**



* Company executives evaluating investment opportunities
* 
* A newly formed aviation division seeking operational safety guidance
* 
* Risk and compliance teams supporting due diligence



**Key Business Questions**

* Which aircraft models have historically been involved in the fewest injuries or fatalities?
* 
* Are certain types of flight operations (e.g., personal, business, commercial) riskier than others?
* 
* How do risks vary by aircraft engine type or manufacturer?
* 
* What are the most common causes or patterns behind high-injury incidents?
* 
* Which trends can help us minimize operational risk in future aircraft acquisitions?
* 
* The goal is to translate these questions into actionable insights using historical accident data and guide data-informed aircraft selection.



**Data Understanding**

**Source of Data**

The dataset used in this project comes from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

&nbsp; It contains detailed records of aircraft accidents and incidents, including injury counts, aircraft characteristics, and purpose of flight.



 **Description of Data**

The dataset includes over 90,000 aviation incident records with the following key fields:

•	Event ID, Date, Location (Latitude \& Longitude)

•	Aircraft Make \& Model

•	Engine Type

•	Purpose of Flight (e.g., Personal, Business, Instructional)

•	Number of Fatal and Non-Fatal Injuries

After cleaning and preprocessing, null values were handled, and irrelevant entries were  removed. 

The refined dataset enabled meaningful analysis of risk across various aircraft attributes and flight purposes.



**Data Analysis**

![Trends Over Time](images/trends.png)

We observe a sharp spike in incidents around 1982, which likely corresponds to improvements in reporting practices rather than an actual surge in accidents. 
Since that time, the number of aviation accidents has steadily declined, likely due to several contributing factors:

* Stricter regulations and oversight

* Improved industry compliance

* Significant technological advancements in aircraft safety systems

While modern aviation is significantly safer today, sustaining this safety record requires continued investment in:

* Advanced equipment

* Ongoing pilot and crew training

* A strong, organization-wide safety culture
